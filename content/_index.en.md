## Failure reporting app

A binder with cards and an excel list no longer enough for you? I am building an app for convenient reporting of failures. ðŸ§°

ðŸ§­ Goals:

  - Priority for ðŸ“± **mobile phones** - I'm supposed to have enough features to be able to use it comfortably on a phone. The PC version is an extension, not the core.
  - **Simplicity** (so that my father can use it without spending a week learning)
  - **Completness** - including all the necessary facilities
  - **Your data is your own** - it's been a few years and you need something different? Planning to do your own analysis in Excel? Export the data you've collected for years and don't start elsewhere from scratch
  -  Being a facilitator for:
    - UR technician (always **up-to-date task list** without constant phone calls and distraction from current work)
    - Operator (simple help call, **video instructions** for machine operation)
    - UR manager (**reports**, current work status)
  - Some technical details: data is stored in the cloud, internet required for operation
