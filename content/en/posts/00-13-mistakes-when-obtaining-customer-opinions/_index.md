What mistakes do we make when obtaining recommendations and how can we avoid them?
 
## Mistake 1: Not asking for recommendations

Dissatisfied customers often leave negative reviews themselves - if only to make themselves feel better. Satisfied customers usually don't do this because their emotional needs are met.

That's why you just have to ask for recommendations.

## Mistake 2: Asking for recommendations too late

Contacting a client with a request for feedback several years after your cooperation has ended does not make much sense. It's better to keep your finger on the pulse and do it faster.

## Mistake 3: Asking for recommendations too early

Sometimes the customer is not able to rate the product because he has not used it yet. Give him time.

## Mistake 4: Putting all the work on the client

For the customer, leaving an opinion is additional work for which no one pays him. Therefore, it is worth making the process of sending recommendations easier, e.g. by preparing a form to make everything clear.


## Mistake 5: Collecting opinions that are too general

Even if you have a lot of opinions, but each of them looks the same (e.g. "The transaction was successful, I recommend it."), it will be difficult for you to convince more people to buy.

It is better to explain to the client what to write and what information is worth providing in the review.

## Mistake 6: Not caring about credibility

Opinions signed by a specific person (doesn't have to be famous!) are much more valuable than anonymous ones, so always ask the customer if you can use his name, surname, possibly a photo and company name.

## Mistake 7: Focusing on the quantity of reviews instead of their quality

Opinions should be detailed and reliable, so there is no point in chasing as many opinions as possible.

## Mistake 8: Using fake reviews

In the age of AI, producing fake reviews with fake customer photos is not particularly difficult. But such recommendations, instead of increasing trust in you, destroy it irreversibly.

Besides, it's illegal.

## Mistake 9: Over-editing opinions

Let your customers have their own style. You can correct any typos or punctuation errors, but leave the rest alone.

Readers may become suspicious of whether such recommendations are true, and their authors may feel offended that you consider them ignorant.

## Mistake 10: No contact from you after your review was published

When possible, thank the customer for giving you a recommendation.

## Mistake 11: Not collecting feedback on an ongoing basis

Old recommendations work less and less well over time. So what if a company has a lot of reviews on Google if the last one is from 6 months ago?

If something works, keep doing it. Don't stop - keep asking your customers for feedback.

## Mistake 12: Not using reviews to model future customers

You can emphasize diversity of opinion when you care about diverse customers. You can also deliberately narrow down the variety of recommendations if you want to target a specific group of customers.

It's important to do it consciously - if you are a trainer and you only post the opinions of men, don't be surprised that you have few women!

## Mistake 13: Not using good reviews effectively

Don't hide the fact that you have something cool to offer! For example, when a customer sends you an e-mail praising your product, don't simply reply: "Thank you."

If you already have recommendations, show them in a clearly visible place on the website, in various marketing materials, in social media - wherever potential customers can see them.
